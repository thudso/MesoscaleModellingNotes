## Motion and deformation

Consider a continuum body $B$ at time $t=0$, which will be the
*reference configuration*. At later times, we describe the new shape of
the body $B_t$ and the position of the points within it by introducing a
*motion* or *deformation map*,
${\boldsymbol \varphi}({\boldsymbol X},t)$, taking points
${\boldsymbol X}\in B$ to their positions ${\boldsymbol x}$ at time $t$.
The new shape of the body at time $t$ is denoted $B_t$, defined to be
all points ${\boldsymbol x}$ with
$$
{\boldsymbol x}= {\boldsymbol \varphi}({\boldsymbol X},t)\qquad\text{for some point }{\boldsymbol X}\in B.
$$
In mathematical notation, we can write
$B_t = {\boldsymbol \varphi}(B,t)$, and the set of points $B_t$ is
referred to as the *deformed configuration*.

::: {.callout-caution title="Example"}
Suppose the reference configuration is a cube of material
with sides of unit length with $0\leq X_i \leq 1$. What happens to the
cube when it undergoes the motion
$$
{\boldsymbol \varphi}({\boldsymbol X},t) = (3X_1t+X_1+t,X_2,X_3)?
$$
:::

An alternative way to describe the shape change of a solid body is to
use a *displacement* function. Instead of describing the new positions
of points in the body in full as the deformation map does, the
displacement measures relative motion. The displacement of a reference
point ${\boldsymbol X}$ at time $t$ is defined to be
$$
{\boldsymbol u}({\boldsymbol X},t) = {\boldsymbol \varphi}({\boldsymbol X},t)-{\boldsymbol X}.
$$
Unfortunately, it is standard in solid mechanics to use
${\boldsymbol u}$ to express the displacement (which is the same as the
notation we used for the Eulerian velocity field in fluids!). Even
though the concepts are distinct, we will stick with this notation
because it is so widely used. In this part, the Eulerian velocity field
will be denoted ${\boldsymbol v}$ instead.

## Strain

The term *strain* is used to refer to a variety of measures of shape
change which are important in describing solids, and there are quite a
few different choices available for different reasons. Strain measures
are usually dimensionless, since they involve first spatial derivatives
of some sort of postion variable.

The first measure we introduce is the deformation gradient
${\boldsymbol F}$. This is a tensor field, defined to be
$$
{\boldsymbol F}= \nabla{\boldsymbol \varphi},\qquad\text{or in components:}\quad F_{ij} = \frac{\partial\varphi_i}{\partial X_j}.$$
To see why this measures strain, consider a small segment of material in
the reference configuration connecting the point ${\boldsymbol X}$ to
the nearby point ${\boldsymbol X}+\delta {\boldsymbol X}$. After the
deformation is applied, we can Taylor expand the differences in the
$i$th coordinate to see that
$$
\varphi_i({\boldsymbol X}+\delta {\boldsymbol X})-\varphi_i({\boldsymbol X}) = \frac{\partial \varphi_i}{\partial X_j}({\boldsymbol X})\delta X_j+O\left(|\delta{\boldsymbol X}|^2\right) \approx F_{ij}({\boldsymbol X})\delta X_j,
$$
and we see that ${\boldsymbol F}$ encodes the local transformation of
the initial displacement $\delta{\boldsymbol X}$. A simple class of
deformation we can consider are those where ${\boldsymbol F}$ is
constant in the body (but possibly time-dependent). This means that the
corresponding motion must take the form
$$
{\boldsymbol \varphi}({\boldsymbol X},t) = {\boldsymbol F}(t){\boldsymbol X}+{\boldsymbol c}(t),
$$
where ${\boldsymbol c}$ is a translation vector. Motions of this type
are called *homogeneous deformations*, and provide us with a simple
class to test our theories with.

::: {.callout-caution title="Example"}
Consider the two-dimensional deformation in which
$$
\begin{aligned}
    x_1 &= \tfrac14(18+4X_1+6X_2)\\
    x_2 &= \tfrac14(14+6X_2).
\end{aligned}
$$
What is the $(2\times 2)$ deformation gradient tensor
${\boldsymbol F}$ in this case? Sketch the deformation of a reference
square of material centred at $(0,0)$.
:::

Let's consider how lengths change under a deformation. Again consider
two nearby points ${\boldsymbol X}$ and
${\boldsymbol X}+\delta{\boldsymbol X}$. After deformation, the distance
between these points can be approximated using the deformation gradient
as follows:
$$
|{\boldsymbol \varphi}({\boldsymbol X}+\delta{\boldsymbol X})-{\boldsymbol \varphi}({\boldsymbol X})|^2 \approx |{\boldsymbol F}\,\delta{\boldsymbol X}|^2 = ({\boldsymbol F}\delta{\boldsymbol X})\cdot({\boldsymbol F}\delta{\boldsymbol X}) = \delta{\boldsymbol X}\cdot\left(({\boldsymbol F}^T{\boldsymbol F})\delta{\boldsymbol X}\right)
$$
where ${\boldsymbol F}^T$ is the transpose, obtained by swapping
components across the diagonal so $(F^T)_{ij} = F_{ji}$. The tensor
${\boldsymbol C}:= {\boldsymbol F}^T{\boldsymbol F}$ is called the right
Cauchy-Green strain, and it provide a way to encode infinitesimal length
change. ${\boldsymbol C}$ is not sensitive to rotations, whereas
${\boldsymbol F}$ is, and it is always symmetric.

The case where there is no length change (and so no shape change) occurs
when ${\boldsymbol C}$ is the identity tensor ${\boldsymbol I}$. If we
shift by removing the identity tensor (and by convention dividing by
$2$), we get another form of strain, called the *Lagrange strain*:
$$
{\boldsymbol E}:= \tfrac12({\boldsymbol C}-{\boldsymbol I}) = \tfrac12({\boldsymbol F}^T{\boldsymbol F}-{\boldsymbol I}).
$$
Another way to measure strain is to use the *displacement gradient*,
denoted
$$
\nabla{\boldsymbol u}= {\boldsymbol F}-{\boldsymbol I},\quad\text{with components}\quad (\nabla {\boldsymbol u})_{ij} = \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X_j}.
$$
If we write the Lagrange strain in terms of $\nabla {\boldsymbol u}$, we
find
$$
{\boldsymbol E}= \frac12\Big(({\boldsymbol I}+\nabla{\boldsymbol u})^T({\boldsymbol I}+\nabla{\boldsymbol u})-{\boldsymbol I}\Big) = \frac12\Big(\nabla{\boldsymbol u}+\nabla{\boldsymbol u}^T+\nabla{\boldsymbol u}^T\nabla{\boldsymbol u}\Big).
$$
If $\nabla{\boldsymbol u}$ is small, then we can linearise this
definition by neglecting the
$\nabla{\boldsymbol u}^T\nabla{\boldsymbol u}$ term, which gives us the
definition of the *infinitesimal strain*, denoted
$$
{\boldsymbol \varepsilon}= \frac12\Big(\nabla{\boldsymbol u}+\nabla{\boldsymbol u}^T\Big)\quad\text{with}\quad \varepsilon_{ij} = \frac12\left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X_j}+\frac{\partial u_j}{\partial X_i}\right).
$$
Notice that ${\boldsymbol C}$, ${\boldsymbol E}$ and
${\boldsymbol \varepsilon}$ are symmetric tensors, while the direct
derivatives ${\boldsymbol F}= \nabla{\boldsymbol \varphi}$ and
$\nabla{\boldsymbol u}$ are not. For much of what we do in this part of
the module, our main focus will be on models where we use the linearised
strain ${\boldsymbol \varepsilon}$, as this is the measure of strain
which is used in linear elasticity theory.

::: {.callout-caution title="Example"}
Again, consider the two-dimensional deformation in which
$$

\end{aligned}
$$
What are the different measures of strain
${\boldsymbol C}$, ${\boldsymbol E}$, ${\boldsymbol \varepsilon}$ in
this case?

## Stress in solids

Recall that in @sec-flu-equations, we showed Newton's second
law implies that
$$
\rho\frac{D{\boldsymbol v}}{Dt} = \nabla\cdot{\boldsymbol S}-\rho g{\boldsymbol e}_3,
$$
where we now use ${\boldsymbol v}$ to denote the velocity field, and
${\boldsymbol S}$ is the *Cauchy stress tensor*. Recall that
${\boldsymbol S}{\boldsymbol n}$ expresses the forces per unit area
acting across a surface with normal ${\boldsymbol n}$ in the deformed
configuration (i.e. in the Eulerian setting). This equation holds for
solids too, it's just that to model these materials, we will need to
change the constitutive equation for ${\boldsymbol S}$.

In particular, we are going to focus on the static form of this equation
in which there is no motion. If ${\boldsymbol v}={\boldsymbol 0}$, we
can rearrange to get the *force balance* equations:
$$
\nabla\cdot{\boldsymbol S}= \rho g{\boldsymbol e}_3\quad\text{or}\quad \frac{\partial S_{ij}}{\partial X_j} = \rho g \delta_{i3}.$$
This gives us 3 equations for 6 unknowns (the components of the stress
tensor), so to close the equations we need a constitutive relation. For
solids, we typically assume ${\boldsymbol S}$ depends on some measure of
strain. This is in constrast to fluids, where it tends to depend only
strain rate.

Before introducing the constitutive relation used in linear elasticity
theory, we'll discuss stress in general. Solids tend to exhibit a lot
more variability in their response to applied stresses, essentially
because they don't flow. To allow us to discuss this response, we'll
introduce the following definitions, which are illustrated in
@fig-stressstates:

- If the stress tensor ${\boldsymbol S}$ takes the form
  $$
  {\boldsymbol S}= \left(
  \begin{array}{ccc}
      -p &  0 & 0 \\
       0 & -p & 0 \\
       0 &  0 & -p
  \end{array}\right),
  $$
  where $p$ is a scalar pressure, we say that
  a *spherical* state of stress exists at ${\boldsymbol x}$.

- The stress is said to be *uniaxial* is there exists Cartesian
  coordinate system in which the stress tensor takes the form
  $$
  {\boldsymbol S}= 
    \left(
    \begin{array}{ccc}
    \sigma & 0 & 0 \\
    0      & 0 & 0 \\
    0      & 0 & 0
    \end{array}\right).
  $$
  If $\sigma>0$, we call this state a *pure tension*, and if $\sigma<0$, a *pure compression*.

- If in some Cartesian coordinate system the stress tensor takes the
  form
  $$
  {\boldsymbol S}=
    \left(
      \begin{array}{ccc}
        0 & \tau & 0 \\
        \tau & 0 & 0 \\
        0    & 0 & 0
      \end{array}
    \right)
  $$
  then we say that a state of *pure shear stress* exists.

- More generally, if in some Cartesian coordinate system
  ${\boldsymbol S}$ takes the form
  $$
  {\boldsymbol S}=
    \left(
      \begin{array}{ccc}
        S_{11} & S_{12} & 0 \\
        S_{21} & S_{22} & 0 \\
        0     & 0     & 0
      \end{array}
    \right),
  $$
  we say that a state of *plane stress* exists.

Most stress states are more general than these particular examples, but
these tend to be the easiest to visualise and understand.

slice of a body.

### Principal stresses

The eigenvalues of ${\boldsymbol S}$ evaluated are called the *principal
stresses*. The corresponding eigenvectors are called the *principal
stress directions*. We note that since the stress tensor is symmetric,
there are three real principal stresses, and three orthogonal principal
stress directions for each point.

Consider a surface with unit normal ${\boldsymbol n}$. The corresponding
stress vector ${\boldsymbol t}= {\boldsymbol S}{\boldsymbol n}$ acting
on this surface can be decomposed into two parts:
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{a \emph{normal stress}:}&\qquad&{\boldsymbol t}_n &= ({\boldsymbol t}\cdot{\boldsymbol n}){\boldsymbol n},\\
    \text{and a \emph{shear stress}:}&\qquad&{\boldsymbol t}_s&= {\boldsymbol t}-({\boldsymbol t}\cdot{\boldsymbol n}){\boldsymbol n},
\end{aligned}
$$
In particular, we have ${\boldsymbol t}={\boldsymbol t}_n+{\boldsymbol t}_s$, and we call
$\sigma_n=|{\boldsymbol t}_n|$ the *normal stress* and
$\sigma_s=|{\boldsymbol t}_s|$ the *shear stress* on the surface with
normal ${\boldsymbol n}$ at ${\boldsymbol x}$.

It is often of interest to understand what sorts of surfaces experience
the largest stresses of various types, because we want to be sure that
the material does not fail. For example, both high levels of tension (a
normal stress state) and high levels of shear stress can induce
cracking. The threshold for these two different modes of failure is
often different, and so the places which may be prone to issues can vary
depending on the material and the shape of a design.

A nice fact is that we can work out the maximal stresses directly using
the principal stresses. If the principal stresses $\sigma_i$ are
distinct and ordered, with $\sigma_1>\sigma_2>\sigma_3$, then

- The *maximum tensile stress* is $\sigma_1$ (assuming $\sigma_1>0$);

- The *maximum compressive stress* is $\sigma_3$ (assuming
  $\sigma_3<0$); and

- The *maximum shear stress* $\sigma_s$ is $\frac12|\sigma_1-\sigma_3|$.

In practice, this provides us with a nice way to post-process a
computational prediction of stress to work out which regions we should
be concerned about: all we need to do is find the stress tensor in the
material, find the appropriate eigenvalues, compute these quantities
relative to their critical values, and visualise the results.

## Hooke's law

Hooke's law is a simple rule about the behaviour of springs which you
probably first learned about in school. It states that the tensile force
$\tau$ needed to increase the length of a spring is directly
proportional to its extension. We can write this law as
$$
\tau = ke\quad\text{with}\quad e = \ell-\ell_0,
$$
where:

- $\tau$ is the tension;

- $k$ is the constant of proportionality, known as the spring constant;

- $e$ is the extension of the spring;

- $\ell$ is the current length; and

- $\ell_0$ is the equilibrium or reference length of the spring.

Clearly, the spring constant $k$ will depend on the exact spring being
stretched. In fact, a simple model is that the spring constant of a
spring made of a given material is approximately inversely proportional
to its equilibrium length. This means that $k = \mathbb{C}/\ell_0$ for
some material constant $\mathbb{C}$ which is independent of the length,
and hence
$$
  \tau = \mathbb{C}\frac{\ell-\ell_0}{\ell_0}.
$$ {#eq-springstrain}
Note that this
hopefully makes intuitive sense to you: a spring which is twice as long
stretches twice as far under the same force; see
@fig-springs.

::: {#fig-springs}
![](tikz/Springs.svg){height=5cm}

Two springs of different equilibrium lengths, expanding
under the same force. The extension in the spring twice as long is twice
as large under the same force.
:::

The ratio of extension over length that appears in
@eq-springstrain is a first example of a measure of
*strain*, describing the change in length relative to some reference
length. In fact, it can be thought of as a component of the
infinitesimal strain ${\boldsymbol \varepsilon}$. To see the connection
with our definitions in the previous chapter, if we introduce a
reference domain $[0,\ell_0]$, then we can define a deformation
$$
\varphi(X) = \frac{\ell}{\ell_0}X\quad\text{for }0\leq X\leq \ell_0.
$$
The deformation gradient in this one-dimensional example is
$$
F = \varphi'(X) = \frac{\ell}{\ell_0},
$$
and the displacement is
$$
u(X) = \varphi(X)-X = \frac{\ell}{\ell_0}X-X = \frac{\ell-\ell_0}{\ell_0}X
$$
so the displacement gradient is
$$
u'(X) = \frac{\ell-\ell_0}{\ell_0}.
$$
Since there is nothing to symmetrise in this case, the infinitesimal
strain is $\varepsilon = \frac{\ell-\ell_0}{\ell_0}$, and so we see that
$$
\tau = \mathbb{C}\varepsilon.
$$
Linear elasticity amounts to a generalisation of this relationship to the full three-dimensional
setting.

## Linear elasticity

As we saw in the first part of the course, forces acting across surfaces
inside and on the boundary of a continuum body can be encoded using the
stress tensor. In linear elasticity theory, we generalise Hooke's law by
assuming that the stress tensor ${\boldsymbol S}$ can be expressed as a
linear function of the infinitesimal strain tensor
${\boldsymbol \varepsilon}$. In this case, the single coefficient
$\mathbb{C}$ discussed above for a spring becomes a fourth-order
elasticity tensor $\mathbb{C}$, with
$$
{\boldsymbol S}= \mathbb{C}{\boldsymbol \varepsilon}\qquad\text{with components}\qquad S_{ij} = \mathbb{C}_{ijkl}\varepsilon_{kl}.
$$
In principle, $\mathbb{C}$ could contain 81 independent parameters (also
sometimes called *moduli*) as it has this many different indices.
However, since ${\boldsymbol S}$ and ${\boldsymbol \varepsilon}$ are
both symmetric and the elasticity tensor satisfies *major symmetry*,
meaning that $\mathbb{C}_{ijkl} =\mathbb{C}_{klij}$, there are in fact
only 21 possible unique parameters in general. In fact, one way to see
this is to use *Voigt notation*, where we relate the vectors
$$
\begin{aligned}
  \widetilde{{\boldsymbol S}} &= (S_{11},S_{22},S_{33},S_{23},S_{31},S_{12}) \\
  \text{and}\quad\widetilde{{\boldsymbol \varepsilon}}&= (\varepsilon_{11},\varepsilon_{22},\varepsilon_{33},2\varepsilon_{23},2\varepsilon_{31},2\varepsilon_{12})
\end{aligned}
$$
via a matrix multiplication. It is common to make the
change of index notation
$$
11\leftrightarrow 1,\,
22\leftrightarrow 2,\,
33\leftrightarrow 3,\,
23=32\leftrightarrow 4,\,
31=13\leftrightarrow 5,\,
12=21\leftrightarrow 6,
$$
and then we have
$$
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
    S_1 \\ S_2 \\ S_3 \\ S_4 \\ S_5 \\ S_6
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{cccccc}
    C_{11} & C_{12} & C_{13} & C_{14} & C_{15} & C_{16} \\
            & C_{22} & C_{23} & C_{24} & C_{25} & C_{26} \\
            &        & C_{33} & C_{34} & C_{35} & C_{36} \\
            &        &        & C_{44} & C_{45} & C_{46} \\
            &        &        &       & C_{55} & C_{56} \\
            &        &        &       &       & C_{66}
\end{array}
\right)
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
    \varepsilon_1 \\ \varepsilon_2 \\ \varepsilon_3 \\ 2\varepsilon_4 \\ 2\varepsilon_5 \\ 2\varepsilon_6
\end{array}
\right),
$$
where the part of the matrix below the diagonal is the
reflection of that above the diagonal, i.e. $C_{ij} = C_{ji}$. The
mysterious factor of 2 appearing is there to ensure that
$$
\tfrac12\widetilde{{\boldsymbol S}}\cdot\widetilde{{\boldsymbol \varepsilon}} = \tfrac12S_{ij}\varepsilon_{ij} = \tfrac12\mathbb{C}_{ijkl}\varepsilon_{ij}\varepsilon_{kl},
$$
which encodes the elastic energy density in the material.

Under more specific assumptions about the symmetries of the underlying
material, the number of independent components reduces much further. A
common simplifying assumption to assume that a material is *isotropic*:
this entails that there are just two independent elasticity parameters,
and the matrix above becomes
$$
\left(
\begin{array}{cccccc}
    C_{11} & C_{12} & C_{12} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    C_{12} & C_{11} & C_{12} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    C_{12} & C_{12} & C_{11} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & C_{44} & 0     & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0     & C_{44} & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0     & 0     & C_{44}
\end{array}
\right),
$$ with the additional restriction that
$C_{12} = C_{11}-2C_{44}$. Even in this simplest case, there are still
twice as many parameters as are needed to describe a Newtonian fluid,
where we have only one viscosity parameter! This is because common
elastic materials are not incompressible (even approximately). Another
common case is crystalline materials with cubic symmetry, where
$C_{11}$, $C_{12}$ and $C_{44}$ are independent parameters. We will
focus in particular on the isotropic case, since this makes various
aspects easier, but the theory can obviously be developed in general.

In an isotropic linear elastic material, the elasticity tensor can be
represented neatly as
$$
\mathbb{C}_{ijkl} = \kappa\, \delta_{ij}\delta_{kl} + G\left(\delta_{ik}\delta_{jl}+\delta_{il}\delta_{jk}-\tfrac23\delta_{ij}\delta_{kl}\right),
$$
or in Voigt notation, the matrix representation is
$$
\left(
    \begin{array}{cccccc}
      \kappa+\frac43G & \kappa-\frac23G & \kappa-\frac23G & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
      \kappa-\frac23G & \kappa+\frac43G & \kappa-\frac23G & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
      \kappa-\frac23G & \kappa-\frac23G & \kappa+\frac43G & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & G & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & G & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & G
    \end{array}
  \right),
$$
The parameters involved here are $\kappa$, the *bulk
modulus*; and $G$, the *shear modulus*. To illustrate why these
parameters have these names, we now consider a couple of simple thought
experiments.

### The bulk modulus

::: {#fig-bulkmodulus}
![](tikz/BulkModulus.svg){height=5cm}

An illustration of the uniform expansion considered in
discussion of bulk modulus.
:::

Consider an isotropic linear elastic material undergoing a uniform
compression or expansion, i.e. experiencing the deformation
${\boldsymbol \varphi}({\boldsymbol X}) = (1+\tfrac13\alpha){\boldsymbol X}$.
The volume of unit cube after this deformation can be expressed using
the determinant of the deformation gradient,
$$
J = \det{\boldsymbol F}= (1+\tfrac13\alpha)^3 = 1+\alpha+\tfrac13\alpha^2+\tfrac{1}{27}\alpha^3.
$$
When $\alpha$ is small, we can neglect the quadratic and cubic terms to
approximate the new volume as $J \approx 1+\alpha$, so $\alpha$ tells us
the approximate change in volume in this case.

Let's now see what the stress in the material, assuming it is an
isotropic linear elastic solid. First, we translate from deformation
into displacement, where
$$
u_i = \tfrac13\alpha X_i\quad\text{so}\quad \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X_j} = \tfrac13\alpha\delta_{ij}\quad\text{and}\quad \varepsilon_{ij} = \tfrac13\alpha\delta_{ij}.
$$
Plugging in, we find
$$
\varepsilon_{kk} = \tfrac13\alpha\delta_{kk} = \alpha,
$$
so
$$
\varepsilon_{ij} - \tfrac13\delta_{ij}\varepsilon_{kk} = \tfrac13\alpha\delta_{ij}-\tfrac13\alpha\delta_{ij} = 0.
$$
The stress tensor is therefore
$$
S_{ij} = \kappa\alpha\delta_{ij}\quad\text{or in tensor notation}\quad{\boldsymbol S}= \kappa\alpha{\boldsymbol I}.
$$
Recalling our definition from above, this is a *spherical* state of
stress, with pressure $p = -\kappa\alpha$, and we see that $\kappa$ is
the constant of proportionality between the approximate volume change
$\alpha$ and the resulting pressure induced in the material.

### The shear modulus

::: {#fig-shearmodulus}
![](tikz/ShearModulus.svg){height=5cm}

A simple shear.
:::

Consider an isotropic linear elastic material undergoing a simple shear
in which
$$
{\boldsymbol \varphi}({\boldsymbol X}) = (X+\alpha Y,Y,Z).
$$
We have
$$
{\boldsymbol u}= (\alpha Y,0,0)\quad\text{so}\quad
  \nabla{\boldsymbol u}= \left(
    \begin{array}{ccc}
      0 & \alpha & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 0
    \end{array}
  \right)\quad\text{and}\quad
  {\boldsymbol \varepsilon}= \left(
    \begin{array}{ccc}
      0 & \tfrac12\alpha & 0 \\
      \tfrac12\alpha & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 0
    \end{array}
  \right).
$$
It is easy to check that $\varepsilon_{kk} = 0$, and so plugging in,
$$
{\boldsymbol S}=
\left(
    \begin{array}{ccc}
        0 & G\alpha & 0 \\
        G\alpha & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0
    \end{array}
\right).
$$
This is a state of pure shear stress, and we see that $G$
is the constant of proportionality relating the shear strain to the
shear stress induced in the material.

### Young's modulus and the Poisson ratio

::: {#fig-uniaxial}
![](tikz/Uniaxial.svg){height=5cm}

A uniaxial stretch.
:::

Along with the bulk and shear moduli, there are other possible elastic
coefficients we can use; another convenient pair are the *Young's
modulus*, $E$ and *Poisson ratio*, $\nu$.

To illustrate what these coefficents are, let's consider stretching the
material in one direction. In general, you may already be aware that
material tends to thin in directions orthogonal to that in which it is
stretched (think of an elastic band). This means it will be useful for
us to consider the material simultaneously contracting in the other
directions, so we consider the deformation
$$
{\boldsymbol \varphi}({\boldsymbol X}) = \big((1+\alpha)X,(1-\beta)Y,(1-\beta)Z\big).
$$
We have
$$
{\boldsymbol u}= (\alpha X,-\beta Y,-\beta Z)\quad\text{so}\quad
\nabla{\boldsymbol u}= \left(
    \begin{array}{ccc}
        \alpha & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & -\beta & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & -\beta
    \end{array}
\right)={\boldsymbol \varepsilon},
$$
where the latter equality holds because $\nabla{\boldsymbol u}$ is symmetric. Plugging in, we find
$$
{\boldsymbol S}=
\left(
    \begin{array}{ccc}
        (\kappa-\tfrac23G)(\alpha-2\beta)+2G\alpha & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & (\kappa-\tfrac23G)(\alpha-2\beta)-2G\beta & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & (\kappa-\tfrac23G)(\alpha-2\beta)-2G\beta
    \end{array}
    \right).
$$
Let us set $\nu = \beta/\alpha$, and pull out a factor of
$\alpha$. Then, working through the algebra, we can write
$$
{\boldsymbol S}= \alpha\left(
    \begin{array}{ccc}
        (\kappa+\tfrac43G)-2\nu(\kappa-\tfrac23G) & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & (\kappa-\tfrac23G)-2\nu(\kappa+\tfrac13G) & 0 \\
          0 & 0 & (\kappa-\tfrac23G)-2\nu(\kappa+\tfrac13G)
    \end{array}
\right).
$$
Now recall that we are free to choose $\beta$, or
equivalently $\nu$. If we choose the special value
$$
\nu = \frac{\kappa-\tfrac23G}{2\kappa+\tfrac23G} = \frac{3\kappa-2G}{2(3\kappa+G)},
$$
then $S_{22}=S_{33}=0$, and so the stresses on the sides orthogonal to
the direction of of our box vanish. This is exactly what we would expect
to happen when we perform a simple stretching experiment, and the value
of $\nu$ is known as the *Poisson ratio* of the material, since it
describes the ratio by which the material thins in directions
perpendicular to that which it is stretched.

If we simply further in the case where we choose $\nu$ as above, we have
$$
{\boldsymbol S}= \alpha\left(
    \begin{array}{ccc}
        \frac{9\kappa G}{3\kappa+G} & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0
    \end{array}
\right).
$$
We can therefore express the only non-zero stress component
as $S_{11} = E\alpha$, where $E = \frac{9\kappa G}{3\kappa+G}$ is the
*Young's modulus* of the material. Note that the Young's modulus is the
equivalent of the coefficient $\mathbb{C}$ which was discussed in the
motivation section on springs above.

### Summary

The 4 parameters $\kappa$, $G$, $\nu$ and $E$ can be used to describe
material behaviour, and we have seen how they are defined based on some
simple thought experiments. In practice, these are the basic experiments
that are used to identify the appropriate parameters in standard tests,
and if the material is truly isotropic, then we can convert between any
pair of the coefficients. You can find a table to do so on Wikipedia;
see the bottom of [this
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus) for example. In
particular, the inverse of the formulae we derived above for $E$ and
$\nu$ are:
$$
\kappa = \frac{E}{3(1-2\nu)}\quad \text{and}\quad G = \frac{E}{2(1+\nu)}.
$$
Note that the cases where $\nu=\tfrac12$ and $\nu=-1$ are problematic,
but most materials have $\nu$ in this range (and most have
$\nu\approx 0.3$).

Some indicative values of the moduli are shown in
Table [2.1](#tab:moduli){reference-type="ref" reference="tab:moduli"}.
As the infinitesimal strain is dimensionless, we find that $\kappa$, $G$
and $E$ all have the same units as stress. Since the Poisson ratio is
really a special strain value, it is dimensionless. The SI unit of
stress is the pascal, written $1\text{Pa}$, which is equivalent to
1Nm$^{-2}$. Given the typical values observed from materials, it is more
common to express the stresses experienced in solids using megapascals
(1MPa = $10^6$Pa) or gigapascals (1GPa = $10^9$Pa).

  The closer that $\nu$ is to the value of $0.5$, the closer the
  material is to being incompressible; most materials have a Poisson
  ratio in the range $0.2$--$0.4$, so lead and rubber are outliers.

## The equations of linear elastostatics

Now we have developed some physical understanding of the elastic moduli,
we focus on the equations of isotropic elasticity. If we use the
constitutive assumption that
${\boldsymbol S}= \mathbb{C}{\boldsymbol \varepsilon}$, the relationship
that
${\boldsymbol \varepsilon}= \frac12(\nabla{\boldsymbol u}+\nabla{\boldsymbol u}^T)$
and substitute into the force balance equation, we get the system of
equations
$$
(\kappa+\tfrac13G)\nabla(\nabla\cdot{\boldsymbol u}) + G\nabla^2{\boldsymbol u}+ \rho g{\boldsymbol e}_3 = {\boldsymbol 0}.
$$
This can be written in component form as
$$
(\kappa+\tfrac13 G)\frac{\partial^2 u_j}{\partial X_i\partial X_j}+G\frac{\partial^2u_i}{\partial X_j\partial X_j}+\rho g\delta_{i3} = 0.
$$
These equations must be accompanied by appropriate boundary conditions.
In simple problems, these are often *displacement* boundary conditions
where ${\boldsymbol u}$ is prescribed on part of the boundary, or
*traction* boundary conditions where ${\boldsymbol S}{\boldsymbol n}$ is
prescribed on part of the boundary. In general, a mixture of these
condition will be used; see for example @fig-elasticityBCs. The full linear elastic problem becomes:
$$
\begin{aligned}
    (\kappa+\tfrac13 G)\nabla(\nabla\cdot{\boldsymbol u}) + G\nabla^2{\boldsymbol u}+ \rho g{\boldsymbol e}_3 &= {\boldsymbol 0} && \text{in }B,\\
    {\boldsymbol S}{\boldsymbol n}&= {\boldsymbol t}&& \text{on }\Gamma_N,\\
    {\boldsymbol u}&= {\boldsymbol u}_0 && \text{on }\Gamma_D.
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-isotropic_elast_forcebalance}
Note there are
in general 3 partial differential equations for 3 components of the
displacement at points inside the domain, and 3 conditions at each
boundary point. This is therefore a closed set of equations, and in
general it has smooth solutions (away from corners and other nasty
boundary points).

### Special cases

It is sometimes convenient to make modelling approximations to reduce
the three-dimensional system of equations. Three important cases of this
are:

1.  **Plane strain**, in which we assume that displacements take place
    only in $x_1,x_2$ plane, and hence
    ${\boldsymbol u}= (u_1(x_1,x_2),u_2(x_1,x_2),0)$. This is used to
    model the interior of a specimen which is very *thick* in the $x_3$
    direction, so that the $u_3$ component doesn't change very much in
    any slice of the body. In this case, we just need to consider the
    reduced matrix
    $$
    \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            S_{11} \\ S_{22} \\ S_{12}
        \end{array}
    \right)
    =
    \frac{E}{(1+\nu)(1-2\nu)}
    \left(
        \begin{array}{ccc}
            1-\nu & \nu & 0 \\
            \nu & 1-\nu & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & \frac{1-2\nu}{2}
        \end{array}
    \right)
    \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            \varepsilon_{11} \\ \varepsilon_{22} \\ 2\varepsilon_{12}
        \end{array}
    \right)
    $$

2.  **Plane stress**, in which we assume that $S_{13}$, $S_{23}$ and
    $S_{33}$ are zero. This is usually used to model a specimen that is
    very *thin* in the $x_3$ direction. In this case, if the top and
    bottom of a sheet are free, then zero traction boundary conditions
    mean that these components are likely to be very small. In this
    case, we just need to consider the reduced matrix
    $$
    \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            S_{11} \\ S_{22} \\ S_{12}
        \end{array}
    \right)
    =
    \frac{E}{1-\nu^2}
    \left(
        \begin{array}{ccc}
            1 & \nu & 0 \\
            \nu & 1 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & \frac{1-\nu}{2}
        \end{array}
    \right)
    \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            \varepsilon_{11} \\ \varepsilon_{22} \\ 2\varepsilon_{12}
        \end{array}
    \right).
    $$

3.  **Anti-plane stress**, in which we assume that the displacement only
    occurs in the $x_3$ direction, so that
    ${\boldsymbol u}=(0,0,u_3(x_1,x_2))$. This is typically used to
    model the cross-section of a long thin component, where loads are
    applied along the axis, such as a tube or bar. In this case, we get
    In this case, we just need to consider the reduced matrix 
    $$
    \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            S_{12} \\ S_{13}
        \end{array}
    \right)
    =
    G
    \left(
        \begin{array}{cc}
            1 & 0 \\
            0 & 1
        \end{array}
    \right)
    \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            2\varepsilon_{12} \\ 2\varepsilon_{13}
        \end{array}
    \right).
    $$
