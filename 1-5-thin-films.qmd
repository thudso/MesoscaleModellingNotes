# Lubrication and Thin Film Dynamics {#sec-flu-thin-films}

In this chapter we consider situations in which the flow domain is long
and thin, leading to so--called 'lubrication flows'. These are routinely
observed in industry (e.g. via coatings applied to almost all products
we own, such as mobile phones), nature (e.g. avalanches or ice sheet
dynamics), agriculture (e.g. in crop spraying), DIY (when we apply
paints to a wall) and biology (e.g. tear film on the eye or coatings
within the body). Such flows can produce remarkably complex behaviour.

From a mathematical modelling perspective, the geometry of the flow will
allow us to make significant simplifications to the full system of
Navier-Stokes equations, firstly for the case of a fluid trapped between
two solid surfaces, and secondly for the case of a liquid film on a
solid surface, where the free surface boundary conditions add even
further complexity. This chapter will bring together many of the aspects
from the earlier ones and also introduce further techniques of applied
mathematics, namely non-dimensionalisation (done in full detail now!)
and a brief look at asymptotic techniques.

## The Lubrication Equation

We begin by considerind the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations in Cartesian coordinates, with gravitational acceleration
pointing in the negative $y$-direction:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} &= 0, \\
\rho\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \right)&= -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \mu\left(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}\right), \\
\rho\left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\right) &= -\frac{\partial p}{\partial y} + \mu\left(\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y^2}\right) - \rho g.
\end{aligned}
$$

### Non-Dimensionalisation

Now, we consider characteristic scales for all the quantities involved
in the equations above: velocity components $U$, pressure $P$, length
$L$ and time $T=L/U$. It is possible that the characteristic time scale may be set by
    something else, e.g. the frequency of an oscillating body, but here
    we will consider the simplest case where it is related to the length
    and velocity scales. Furthermore, let us consider different scales
for lengths and velocities in the $x$-direction and $y$-direction which
will be important for allowing us to simplify our equations based on the
geometry of the flow domain. Because we are looking at thin films, we
expect the domain to be long and thin, so we let the characteristic
length in the $x$-direction be $L_x=L$ and the characteristic one in the
$y$-direction be $L_y=\varepsilon L$, where $\varepsilon$ is a
(dimensionless) number which gives the aspect ratio $L_x/L_y$ of our
geometry. We will later exploit the fact that $\varepsilon\ll 1$ to
simplify our problem. Similarly, we expect a scale separation in the
velocities, and the corresponding choices are $U_x=U$ and
$U_y=\varepsilon U$. See @fig-thin-film-geometry for an example.

Characteristic geometry for a lubrication flow.
:::

We use these scales to represent all variables in terms of their
characteristic size multiplied by a dimensionless variable. By
definition, the dimensionless variables must have characteristic 'size'
$\sim 1$. In doing so, we are able to establish the size of different
terms and thus work out which are negligible. We consider
$$
x=L\tilde{x},\qquad y=\varepsilon L\tilde{y},\qquad  u=U\tilde{u},\qquad v=\varepsilon U\tilde{v},\qquad p=P\tilde{p}
$$
and substituting these into the Navier-Stokes equations gives
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{U}{L}\frac{\partial \tilde{u}}{\partial \tilde{x}}+\frac{U}{L}\frac{\partial \tilde{v}}{\partial \tilde{y}} &= 0, \\
\frac{\rho U^2}{L}\left(\frac{\partial\tilde{u}}{\partial \tilde{t}} + \tilde{u}\frac{\partial \tilde{u}}{\partial \tilde{x}} + \tilde{v}\frac{\partial \tilde{u}}{\partial \tilde{y}}\right) &= -\frac{P}{L}\frac{\partial \tilde{p}}{\partial \tilde{x}} + \frac{\mu U}{L^2}\left(\frac{\partial^2 \tilde{u}}{\partial \tilde{x}^2} + \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \frac{\partial^2 \tilde{u}}{\partial \tilde{y}^2}\right), \\
\frac{\varepsilon \rho U^2}{L}\left(\frac{\partial \tilde{v}}{\partial \tilde{t}} + \tilde{u}\frac{\partial \tilde{v}}{\partial \tilde{x}} + \tilde{v}\frac{\partial \tilde{v}}{\partial \tilde{y}}\right) &= -\frac{P}{\varepsilon L}\frac{\partial \tilde{p}}{\partial \tilde{y}} + \frac{\varepsilon \mu U}{L^2}\left(\frac{\partial^2 \tilde{v}}{\partial \tilde{x}^2} + \frac{1}{\varepsilon}\frac{\partial^2 \tilde{v}}{\partial \tilde{y}^2}\right) - \rho g.
\end{aligned}
$$
from which we can see that a good scale for the pressure
would be $\frac{P}{L} =  \frac{\mu U}{\varepsilon^2 L^2}$ which would
ensure that pressure term
$\frac{P}{L}\frac{\partial \tilde{p}}{\partial \tilde{x}}$ is comparable
with the (dominant as $\varepsilon \to 0$) viscous term
$\frac{\mu U}{L^2 \varepsilon^2}\frac{\partial^2 \tilde{u}}{\partial \tilde{y}^2}$
which we have already seen drives Poiseuille flow. Making this choice
and rearranging gives
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \tilde{u}}{\partial \tilde{x}}+\frac{\partial \tilde{v}}{\partial \tilde{y}} &= 0, \\
\varepsilon^2 \mathrm{Re}\left(\frac{\partial\tilde{u}}{\partial \tilde{t}} + \tilde{u}\frac{\partial \tilde{u}}{\partial \tilde{x}} + \tilde{v}\frac{\partial \tilde{u}}{\partial \tilde{y}}\right) &= -\frac{\partial \tilde{p}}{\partial \tilde{x}} + \varepsilon^2\frac{\partial^2 \tilde{u}}{\partial \tilde{x}^2} +\frac{\partial^2 \tilde{u}}{\partial \tilde{y}^2}, \\
\varepsilon^4 \mathrm{Re}\left(\frac{\partial \tilde{v}}{\partial \tilde{t}} + \tilde{u}\frac{\partial \tilde{v}}{\partial \tilde{x}} + \tilde{v}\frac{\partial \tilde{v}}{\partial \tilde{y}}\right) &= -\frac{\partial \tilde{p}}{\partial \tilde{y}} + \varepsilon^4\frac{\partial^2 \tilde{v}}{\partial \tilde{x}^2} + \varepsilon^2\frac{\partial^2 \tilde{v}}{\partial \tilde{y}^2} - \varepsilon^3 \mathrm{St},
\end{aligned}
$$
where we have recognised the Reynolds number
$\mathrm{Re}=\frac{\rho U L}{\mu}$ and we introduce a new dimensionless
number, the Stokes number $\mathrm{St}=\frac{\rho gL^2}{\mu U}$. The
latter number describes the ratio between gravitational and viscous
forces.

### Lubrication Approximation

Setting $\varepsilon=1$ at this stage would give us the dimensionless
Navier-Stokes equations for the case in which the characteristic
dimensions are roughly the same in all directions. We could then decide
whether or not the inertial terms are negligible or not by calculating
$\mathrm{Re}$, as we did before. However, this time we want to use the
fact that $\varepsilon \ll 1$ to simplify our equations. Assume further
that $\varepsilon^2 \mathrm{Re}\ll 1$ and
$\varepsilon^3 \mathrm{St}\ll1$. This does not meean that $\mathrm{Re}$
or $\mathrm{St}$ are small themselves, just that they are not too big
when compared to the aspect ratio of the domain. We then simply ignore
all terms multiplied by $\varepsilon$ (and higher powers, which are
even smaller) to obtain:
$$
\frac{\partial \tilde{u}}{\partial \tilde{x}}+\frac{\partial \tilde{v}}{\partial \tilde{y}}= 0,
$$ {#eq-incom}
$$
0 = -\frac{\partial \tilde{p}}{\partial \tilde{x}} +\frac{\partial^2 \tilde{u}}{\partial \tilde{y}^2},
$$ {#eq-xmom}
$$
0 = -\frac{\partial \tilde{p}}{\partial \tilde{y}},
$$ {#eq-ymom}
which is a huge simplification on the full system above.
Strictly speaking, we could use regular asymptotics and take the
    leading order terms, but for this situation the result would be the
    same. Asymptotic expansions work by writing the dependent variables
    as a power series (usually) in the small variable, e.g.
    $\tilde{u}=\tilde{u}_0 + \varepsilon\tilde{u}_1+\varepsilon^2\tilde{u}_2+...$,
    which allows one to keep track of the size of each term in the
    equations. However, this is only necessary here if we take a second
    term in the expansion, e.g. consider the equations for
    $\tilde{u}_1$, which we will not be doing.
Notice that all the inertial terms are gone (the time derivatives and
convective terms on the left-hand side of second and third equations),
as is the gravitational force. What remains is the equation of
incompressibility, the pressure gradients and a viscous terms associated
with gradients of $u$ with respect to $y$, as we also saw for
plane-parallel shear flows (i.e. Couette and Poiseuille flow). The
assumption $\varepsilon \ll 1$ is known as the lubrication
approximation, for reasons that will become apparent.

### Reynolds' Lubrication Equation

Consider now a particular situation, in which a fluid is trapped between
rigid solid boundaries: one at $\tilde{y}=0$, which moves parallel to
itself with speed $\tilde{u}=\tilde{U}_b$, and the other one at
$\tilde{y}=\tilde{h}(\tilde{x},\tilde{t})$ (i.e. the solid top is not
necessarily flat and can move in time). Clearly it is natural to scale
$h$ with $L_y$ so that $h = \varepsilon L \tilde{h}$. This is the
typical setup for lubrication problems - e.g. for a slider bearing where
solid parts 'slip' past each other due to a thin lubricating layer of
liquid (see example below). In this case, our boundary conditions become
no-slip
$$
\begin{aligned}
\tilde{u}&=\tilde{U}_b,&\tilde{v}&=0 &\qquad&\text{at} &\tilde{y}&=0 \\
\tilde{u}&=0,& \tilde{v}&=\frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{t}} &\qquad&\text{at} &\tilde{y}&=\tilde{h}(\tilde{x},\tilde{t})
\end{aligned}
$$
where, for simplicity, we have assumed that the solid at $\tilde{y}=\tilde{h}$ only moves vertically.

We start by integrating the incompressibility equation @eq-incom
'across the channel', i.e. in the $y$-direction, to give
$$
0 = \int^{\tilde{h}(\tilde{x},\tilde{t})}_{0}  \left(\frac{\partial \tilde{u}}{\partial \tilde{x}}+\frac{\partial \tilde{v}}{\partial \tilde{y}}\right) d\tilde{y} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \tilde{x}}\left(\int^{\tilde{h}(\tilde{x},\tilde{t})}_0 \tilde{u} d\tilde{y}\right) - \left.\tilde{u}\frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}}\right|_{\tilde{y}=\tilde{h}(\tilde{x},\tilde{t})} + \left[\tilde{v}\right]^{\tilde{y}=\tilde{h}(\tilde{x},\tilde{t})}_{\tilde{y}=0}
$$
where to bring the derivative out of the integral we have used Leibniz's
rule (see the corresponding [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_integral_rule)), where
care must be taken when the limits of integration are themselves
functions. Applying our boundary conditions for $\tilde{u}$ and
$\tilde{v}$ we obtain
$$
\frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{t}} + \frac{\partial (\tilde{h}\bar{\tilde{u}}) }{\partial \tilde{x}}=0
$$ {#eq-evo}
where we have introduced the mean velocity across the channel (i.e.
'depth-wise averaged velocity')
$$
\bar{\tilde{u}} = \frac{1}{\tilde{h}} \int^{\tilde{h}(\tilde{x},\tilde{t})}_0 \tilde{u} d\tilde{y}.
$$ {#eq-uav}

Next, to obtain an expression for $\bar{\tilde{u}}$ we must integrate
the momentum equations. From the $y$-momentum equation @eq-ymom we
find that $\tilde{p} = \tilde{p}(\tilde{x},\tilde{t})$, i.e. the
pressure does not change across the channel at a given $\tilde{x}$, so
we can integrate the $x$-momentum equation @eq-xmom
across the channel in $\tilde{y}$ to obtain
$$
\tilde{u}(\tilde{x},\tilde{t}) = \frac{\tilde{y}^2}{2}\frac{\partial \tilde{p}}{\partial \tilde{x}}  + A(\tilde{x},\tilde{t}) \tilde{y} + B(\tilde{x},\tilde{t})
$$
where $A$ and $B$ are arbitrary functions appearing after partial
integration in $\tilde{y}$. Applying the no-slip boundary conditions
gives
$$
\tilde{u}(\tilde{x},\tilde{t}) = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial \tilde{p}}{\partial \tilde{x}} \tilde{y}(\tilde{h}-\tilde{y}) + \tilde{U}_b\left(1-\frac{\tilde{y}}{\tilde{h}}\right)
$$
from which we can clearly identify a Poiseuille component driven by the
pressure gradient (first term on the right-hand side) and a Couette flow
component (second term) driven by the motion of the bottom boundary.
Integrating this expression in $y$ across the channel gives
$$
\bar{\tilde{u}} = -\frac{\tilde{h}^2}{12}\frac{\partial \tilde{p}}{\partial \tilde{x}} + \frac{\tilde{U}_b}{2}.
$$
Substituting the resulting expressions back into @eq-evo gives
Reynolds' equation
$$
\frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{t}} +\frac{\tilde{U}_b}{2} \frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}}= \frac{\partial}{\partial \tilde{x}}\left( \frac{\tilde{h}^3}{12}\frac{\partial \tilde{p}}{\partial \tilde{x}}\right),
$$ {#eq-reynolds}
which in dimensional variables would give us
$$
\mu\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} +\frac{\mu U_b}{2} \frac{\partial h}{\partial x}= \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( \frac{h^3}{12}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\right).
$$
Note that this is an equation for the unknown pressure $p=p(x,t)$, as
the film thickness $h$ is assumed to be prescribed in this case.

### Example: Slider Bearing

A classical case for demonstrating the power of lubrication is to
consider the slider bearing @fig-slider
which works by forcing liquid (of viscosity $\mu$) into a converging
channel in order to support loads and reduce wear associated with
solid-on-solid contacts.

Consider a solid boundary at $y=h(x)$ and sit in a frame of reference in
which the top boundary is stationary and the bottom boundary moves with
speed $U_b$. To make things a little more specific, we consider the
region $0\le x\le L_x$ the top boundary at
$h(x) = L_y - \varepsilon^2 m x$, where we have chosen the gradient of
the slope to scale with $\varepsilon^2$ to represent a small change in
height across the domain which also ensures the top boundary never
touches the bottom one. Outside the lubrication region we assume the
pressure takes its atmospheric value $p_{\text{atm}}$ and to simplify
matters we shift the pressure $p\to p+p_{\text{atm}}$, taking it
relative to the value $p_{\text{atm}}$ so that $p(0)=p(L_x)=0$.

Geometry for a slider bearing.

Sensible characteristic scales for our problem are then $U_b$ (so that
$\tilde{U}_b=1$), $L_x$ and $L_y$ so our dimensionless problem, which is
steady, is
$$
\frac{1}{2} \frac{d \tilde{h}}{d\tilde{x}}= \frac{d}{d\tilde{x}}\left( \frac{\tilde{h}^3}{12}\frac{d\tilde{p}}{d\tilde{x}}\right)
$$
subject to $\tilde{p}(0)=\tilde{p}(1)=0$ and with
$\tilde{h}(\tilde{x}) = 1- \varepsilon m \tilde{x}$. Full derivatives
our now used as $\tilde{p}$ is a function of $\tilde{x}$ only.
Integrating, we obtain
$$
\frac{d \tilde{p}}{d\tilde{x}}=\frac{6(\tilde{h}-\tilde{h}_0)}{\tilde{h}^3}\qquad\hbox{where } \tilde{h}_0 \hbox{ is a constant},
$$
and integrating again we find
$$
\tilde{p}(\tilde{x})=\int_0^{\tilde{x}} \frac{6(\tilde{h}(\tilde{s})-\tilde{h}_0)}{\tilde{h}(s)^3} d\tilde{s}
$$
where $\tilde{s}$ is a dummy integration variable. The result (check
this yourself) for our particular geometry is
$$
\tilde{p}(\tilde{x}) = 6\left[\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon m(1-\varepsilon m\tilde{x})}-\frac{h_0}{2\varepsilon m(1-\varepsilon m\tilde{x})^2}\right)-\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon m} - \frac{h_0}{2\varepsilon m}\right)\right]
$$
and we can fix the constant of integration by applying $\tilde{p}(1)=0$
to find $h_0 = \frac{2(\varepsilon m-1)}{\varepsilon m-2}$, so that
finally
$$
\tilde{p}(\tilde{x}) = \frac{6\varepsilon m \tilde{x}(\tilde{x}-1)}{(\varepsilon m-2)(1-\varepsilon m \tilde{x})^2}.
$$
Recalling that pressure was scaled with
$p = \tilde{p}\frac{\mu U_b}{\varepsilon^2 L_x}$ we find that
$$
p(x)= \frac{6\mu U_b}{\varepsilon L_x} \,\frac{m  (x/L_x)(x/L_x-1)}{(\varepsilon m-2)(1-\varepsilon m x/L_x)^2}.
$$
Notably, we find $p\sim 1/\varepsilon$ (the $\sim$ indicates the 'order
of' a term, i.e. the most important term, as a limit is taken) as
$\varepsilon \to 0$, which shows that the pressure diverges (i.e. goes
to infinity) as the channel becomes thinner $\varepsilon\to0$.

To see how the lubricant can support a load, we must calculate the
upward force (per unit length, as we are in 2D) on the body. In the
lubrication formulation, the leading order terms for the stress (see
below) are the pressure normal to the solid and the viscous shear stress
(the
$\mu\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\right)$
term) tangential to it. Notably, one can show that the tangential force
scales as $F_x\sim 1$ (try to do this, if you like). This is why
lubrication films support massive normal forces, as
$F_y\sim 1/\varepsilon$ whilst allowing tangential slippage as
$F_x \sim 1 \ll F_y$ when the channel is sufficiently thin
($\varepsilon \ll1$).

## Thin Film Equations

Let us now consider a different application of the lubrication
approximation, where we would like to consider the dynamics of thin
liquid films with free surfaces. In other words, we are now primarily
interested in liquid films, whose free surface is at $y=h(x,t)$,
supported on solid surfaces. So the problem changes in character, rather
than knowing the height of the upper boundary and finding the pressure
(and hence the force) acting on it using the Reynolds equation
@eq-reynolds, we now have an equation for the pressure at
the boundary (involving surface tension) and would like to find the
height as part of the solution. In order to proceed, we must first
consider what happens to our boundary conditions under the lubrication
approximation.

![](tikz/ThinFilmFreeSurface.svg){height=5cm}

Setup for a thin film flow, where the surface at $y=h(x,t)$ is now
free.
:::

### Free Surface Boundary Conditions Under Lubrication Approximation

At the free surface $y=h(x,t)$ we first note that under the lubrication
approximation
$$
\begin{aligned}
\bfn
&= \frac{(-\frac{\partial h}{\partial x},1)}{\left(1+\left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}\right)^2\right)^{1/2}} =  \frac{(-\varepsilon\frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}},1)}{\left(1+\varepsilon^2\left(\frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}}\right)^2\right)^{1/2}}
\approx \left(-\varepsilon\frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}},1\right), \\
\bft
&= \frac{(1,\frac{\partial h}{\partial x})}{\left(1+\left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}\right)^2\right)^{1/2}}\approx \left(1,\varepsilon\frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}}\right)\\
\nabla\cdot\bfn
&= -\frac{\frac{\partial^2 h}{\partial x^2}}{\left(1+\left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}\right)^2\right)^{3/2}}
\approx -\frac{\varepsilon}{L}\frac{\partial^2 \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}^2}
\end{aligned}
$$
and that the viscous stress tensor $S_{ij}$ is given by
$$
S_{ij} =\frac{\mu U}{L}\begin{pmatrix}
-\frac{\tilde{p}}{\varepsilon^2}   +2\frac{\partial \tilde{u}}{\partial \tilde{x}} & \varepsilon^{-1} \frac{\partial \tilde{u}}{\partial \tilde{y}} + \varepsilon\frac{\partial \tilde{v}}{\partial \tilde{x}}\\
\varepsilon^{-1}\frac{\partial \tilde{u}}{\partial \tilde{y}} + \varepsilon\frac{\partial \tilde{v}}{\partial \tilde{x}} & -\frac{\tilde{p}}{\varepsilon^2}  +2\frac{\partial \tilde{v}}{\partial \tilde{y}}
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

Our boundary conditions are the kinematic ($\frac{D f}{Dt}=0$) condition
$$
\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} +  u\frac{\partial h}{\partial x} = v
$$
and our dynamic condition
($-p_{\text{atm}}\,\bfn-\bfS\cdot\bfn = \bfn\,\sigma\nabla\cdot\bfn$)
which we split into tangential and normal components (by dotting our
dynamic condition with $\bft$ and $\bfn$, respectively) to
obtain
$$
\bft\cdot(\bfS\bfn) =0 \qquad \hbox{and}\qquad -p_{\text{atm}}-\bfn\cdot(\bfS\bfn) = \sigma\nabla\cdot\bfn.
$$

Therefore, after identifying the dominant terms in each equation, our
leading order dimensionless equations are the kinematic equation
$$
\frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{t}} +  \tilde{u}\frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}} = \tilde{v}
$$ {#eq-kin}
tangential stress equation
$$
\frac{\partial \tilde{u}}{\partial \tilde{y}}=0\qquad\hbox{at}\qquad \tilde{y}=\tilde{h}(\tilde{x},\tilde{t})
$$ {#eq-tang}
and normal stress equation
$$
\tilde{p} - \tilde{p}_{\text{atm}} =  -\frac{\sigma\varepsilon^3}{\mu U}\frac{\partial^2 \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}^2}\qquad\hbox{at}\qquad \tilde{y}=\tilde{h}(\tilde{x},\tilde{t})
$$
where we can again identify a dimensionless parameter the capillary
number $\mathrm{Ca}=\frac{\mu U}{\sigma}$. At this stage, we can choose
to either neglect the surface tension terms
$\mathrm{Ca}\,\varepsilon^{-3} \ll 1$ or keep them alongside the
pressure terms $\mathrm{Ca}\,\varepsilon^{-3}\sim1$ and the choice will
depend on the problem in question. We choose the latter option and
redefine a scaled capillary number
$\overline{\mathrm{Ca}} = \mathrm{Ca}\,\varepsilon^{-3} = \frac{\mu U L_x^3}{\sigma L_y^3}$
so that
$$
\tilde{p} - \tilde{p}_{\text{atm}} =  -\overline{\mathrm{Ca}}^{-1}\frac{\partial^2 \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}^2}\qquad\hbox{at}\qquad \tilde{y}=\tilde{h}(\tilde{x},\tilde{t}).
$$ {#eq-norm}

### Thin Film Equations

Applying our new boundary conditions are combined with the previous
setup of bulk equations @eq-incom, @eq-xmom and @eq-ymom
alongside boundary conditions at $y=0$, where for
simplicity we assume a stationary solid
$$
\tilde{u}=\tilde{v}=0\qquad\hbox{at}\qquad \tilde{y}=0.
$$
and the procedure will be similar to before, expect now we have a boundary
condition for $\tilde{p}$ and would like to find $\tilde{h}$ as part of
the solution.

Integrating the incompressibility equation @eq-incom
'across the channel' gives
$$
0 =  \frac{\partial}{\partial \tilde{x}}\left(\int^{\tilde{h}(\tilde{x},\tilde{t})}_0 \tilde{u} d\tilde{y}\right) - \left.\tilde{u}\frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}}\right|_{\tilde{y}=\tilde{h}(\tilde{x},\tilde{t})} + \left[\tilde{v}\right]^{\tilde{y}=\tilde{h}(\tilde{x},\tilde{t})}_{\tilde{y}=0}.
$$
Applying the kinematic boundary conditions on $\tilde{v}$, that is
@eq-kin, we obtain
$$
0 =  \frac{\partial ( \tilde{h}\bar{\tilde{u}})}{\partial\tilde{x}}  - \left.\tilde{u}\frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}}\right|_{\tilde{y}=\tilde{h}(x,t)} + \frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{t}} +  \left.\tilde{u}\frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}}\right|_{\tilde{y}=\tilde{h}(x,t)} = \frac{\partial (\tilde{h} \bar{\tilde{u}})}{\partial\tilde{x}}   + \frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{t}}
$$
where we have again used the mean velocity @eq-uav across the channel.

Noting from @eq-ymom that the pressure does not depend on $y$, at every
point in $(x,t)$ it must be equal to its value at the free surface,
given by @eq-norm so that
$$
\tilde{p}(\tilde{x},\tilde{t}) =  \tilde{p}_{\text{atm}}  -\overline{\mathrm{Ca}}^{-1}\frac{\partial^2 \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}^2}\qquad\implies\qquad \frac{\partial \tilde{p}}{\partial \tilde{x}} =-\overline{\mathrm{Ca}}^{-1}\frac{\partial^3 \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}^3}
$$
and hence the $x$-momentum equation @eq-xmom becomes
$$
\frac{\partial \tilde{p}}{\partial \tilde{x}} = -\overline{\mathrm{Ca}}^{-1}\frac{\partial^3 \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}^3} = \frac{\partial^2 \tilde{u}}{\partial \tilde{y}^2}.
$$
Integrating this we find
$$
\tilde{u} = -\overline{\mathrm{Ca}}^{-1}\frac{\partial^3 \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}^3} \frac{\tilde{y}^2}{2} +C(\tilde{x},\tilde{t}) y + D(\tilde{x},\tilde{t})
$$
which with $\tilde{u}(0)=0$ and
$\left.\frac{\partial \tilde{u}}{\partial \tilde{y}}\right|_{\tilde{y}=\tilde{h}}=0$
gives
$$
\tilde{u} =  -\overline{\mathrm{Ca}}^{-1}\frac{\partial^3 \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}^3} \tilde{y}(\frac{\tilde{y}}{2}-\tilde{h})
$$
so that from @eq-uav we have
$$
\bar{\tilde{u}} = -\frac{1}{\tilde{h}}\overline{\mathrm{Ca}}^{-1}\frac{\partial^3 \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}^3} \left[\frac{\tilde{y^3}}{6}-\tilde{h}\frac{\tilde{y^2}}{2}\right]^{\tilde{h}}_0 = \frac{\tilde{h}^2}{3}\overline{\mathrm{Ca}}^{-1}\frac{\partial^3 \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}^3}
$$ {#eq-meanu}
and finally we obtain the thin film equation
$$
\frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{t}} +\frac{1}{3\mathrm{Ca}}\frac{\partial}{\partial\tilde{x}}\left( \tilde{h}^3\frac{\partial^3 \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}^3} \right) =0.
$$ {#eq-thinfilm}

In dimensional terms the thin film equation is given by
$$
\mu\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} +\frac{\sigma}{3}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( h^3\frac{\partial^3 h}{\partial x^3} \right) =0.
$$
showing that the equation represents flow that is governed by a balance
of viscous (first term) and surface tension (second term). Remarkably,
we have gone from the impenetrable-looking Navier-Stokes equations with
complex free surface boundary conditions down to a single partial
differential equation for the height of the free surface $\tilde{h}$.
The only disadvantage is that we have now introduced higher order
derivatives that will need care when computed numerically and
considerable nonlinearity. Notably, this suggests we will need two
boundary conditions on $\tilde{h}$ and/or its derivatives at each end of
the domain.

#### Boundary Conditions

One can consider numerous different possibilities, but one of the
simplest occurs if we think of the boundaries of our domain either being
a rigid vertical solid which the free surface meets perpendicularly
(i.e. $\frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}}=0$) or a symmetry
plane meaning again that
$\frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}}=0$. Also, in both cases
there will be no mean velocity at the boundary so that
$\bar{\tilde{u}}=0$ which from
@eq-meanu means that $\frac{\partial^3 \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}^3} =0$ also.
Therefore, in these cases our two boundary conditions at each end of the
domain are given by
$$
\frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}} =\frac{\partial^3 \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}^3} =0\qquad\hbox{at}\qquad \tilde{x}=0,1
$$ {#eq-bcs}

Of course, many other possibilities exist, e.g. including periodic
boundary conditions or conditions that specify a particular gradient for
the free surface.

**Project 3: Fluctuations and Breakup of Nanoscale Liquid Films**\
In this project, the intention is to build a code capable of capturing
thin film flow dynamics and to augment this with additional terms that
represent physics that is not classically accounted for within the
Navier-Stokes framework. Two relatively recent review articles have been
written on the general topic of thin films by Oron et al 97 and Craster
& Matar 09 - I would recommend reading the introductions for some
background, although there is nothing about fluctuations in these
reviews.\

##### Aims:

To write an approximately 10 page report that demonstrates:

- engagement with the literature on thin film dynamics;

- computational results for a thin film flow containing physics beyond
  classical theory; and

- validation of code against known results in the literature.

**Project Ideas**

A starting point for this project is to write a code that solves the
thin film equation subject to appropriate boundary conditions. The
simplest scheme one could think of would be an explicit forward Euler
scheme for time stepping, as considered in Week 3 for 'Start Up Flow',
alongside finite differences for the spatial derivatives. It is clear
this case will be more complex than previous ones, as
([\[eq-thinfilm\]](#eq-thinfilm){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq-thinfilm"}) contains higher derivatives (fourth order) as
well as considerable nonlinearity.\
**Given Information on Discretisation** Finite difference coefficients
for higher derivatives can either be derived or found here
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_coefficient>. With
equations of the form
([\[eq-thinfilm\]](#eq-thinfilm){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq-thinfilm"}) one can either use the product rule on the
spatial derivative to obtain $h^3 h'''' + 3h^2 h'''$ and then use the
finite difference method on this, or one can consider the derivative
applied directly to the quantity inside
$\frac{\partial}{\partial \tilde{x}}$, which is the method I found to be
most accurate (please feel free to explore).

To be more precise, one can calculate a quantity
$\tilde{Q}_i = \tilde{h_i}^3\left.\frac{\partial^3 \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}^3}\right|_{x=x_i}$
at each node $i$, using a finite difference formula (e.g. second order)
for the third derivative, and then apply a central difference to this
quantity to obtain
$$
\left.\frac{\partial \tilde{Q}}{\partial \tilde{x}}\right|_{x=x_i} = \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial\tilde{x}}\left( \tilde{h}^3\frac{\partial^3 \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}^3} \right)\right|_{x=x_i} = \frac{\tilde{Q}_{i+1} - \tilde{Q}_{i-1}}{2 \tilde{dx}}
$$
where $\tilde{dx}$ is the mesh size.

You may also wish to experiment with the time step that will produce
stable time-stepping, with the equations suggesting this could be quite
strict with $d\tilde{t} \ll d\tilde{x}^4$.

As with all projects, the suggestions below are intended to give you
ideas of what can be done, but you should feel free to follow your own
path if you wish.

- Consider the flattening of a film from an initially perturbed
  profile - e.g. you could choose to sinusoidally perturb the
  equilibrium height $\tilde{h}=1$.

- Determine the limitations on the time step.

- Investigate higher order explicit time-stepping methods and/or
  implicit methods, if this interests you.

One direction you may wish to consider is the stability of thin liquid
films, which is of critical importance for coatings. The setup here
would be to take a thin film of equilibrium height $\tilde{h}=1$ and
take small perturbations to this, e.g. of sinusoidal form
$\tilde{h} = 1+\tilde{A}\cos(\tilde{k} \tilde{x})$ where $\tilde{A}$ is
the amplitude of the disturbance and $\tilde{k}$ is the wavenumber.

- Perform numerical experiments using
  ([\[eq-thinfilm\]](#eq-thinfilm){reference-type="ref"
  reference="eq-thinfilm"}) to see when the film breaks up. You should
  find that for small perturbations $A\ll 1$ the film is always stable.

- The (linear) stability of thin films goes against evidence from
  experiments and molecular dynamics simulations (see above) which show
  that very thin (nanoscopic) films can breakup (i.e. the free surface
  contacts the solid, which subsequently becomes dry). One physical
  reason why this could occur is that when films become very thin,
  long-range attractive van-der-Waals forces (in the simplest case, e.g.
  via dipole-dipole interactions) create an extra pressure on the free
  surface that is not accounted for in the classical theory. One can
  crudely model these using an additional force (or 'disjoining
  pressure') on the free surface which forces it towards the solid (see
  § 2E of Oron et al 97, in the Reading List). The potential associated
  with this force has the (dimensional) form
  $\phi=\frac{A_{dim}}{6\pi h^3}$ where $A_{dim}$ is the Hamaker
  constant, with $A>0$ corresponding to attraction between the
  interfaces, which is the case we are interested in. In the thin film
  framework, this force leads to an additional term in
  ([\[eq-thinfilm\]](#eq-thinfilm){reference-type="ref"
  reference="eq-thinfilm"}) so that
  $$
  \frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{t}} +\frac{\partial}{\partial\tilde{x}}\left( \frac{\tilde{h}^3}{3\mathrm{Ca}}\frac{\partial^3 \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}^3} + \frac{A}{\tilde{h}}\frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}} \right) =0.
  $$
  where $A$ is a dimensionless parameter prescribing the strength of the
  vdW force.

- Connect to the stability analysis in Oron et al 97 (e.g. see equation
  2.42b for critical wavenumber), which shows both (i) how large the
  domain must be to allow an instability to grow and (ii) the growth
  rate of the instability in its initial (linear) stages. You should be
  able to compare your simulations to these predictions.

- Consider the final stages of the free surfaces' evolution before it
  ruptures (i.e. the minimum height of the film goes to zero). It is
  often the case that near the rupture, which we assume occurs at some
  time $t_r$, theories exist to see how this singularity is approached
  (usually via similarity solutions, which we do not discuss here). This
  is the case here, with Oron et al 97 predicting that "the minimal
  thickness of the film close to the rupture point is therefore expected
  to decrease linearly with time" - i.e., we should expect to see
  $\tilde{h}_{min}  = C(\tilde{t}_r - \tilde{t})$ where $C$ is a
  constant. In contrast, in Zhang & Lister 99, the prediction is that
  $\tilde{h}_{min}  = C(\tilde{t}_r - \tilde{t})^{1/5}$. Note that to
  'resolve' the rupture one may have to consider a non-uniform grid, as
  in Zhang & Lister 99. Engage with this literature and see what your
  code recovers\...

Alternatively, one may consider the influence that thermal fluctuations
have on thin nanoscopic liquid films, as seen in molecular dynamics
simulations. Notably, the standard Navier-Stokes equations do not
incorporate thermal fluctuations, so that one must consider the
so-called Fluctuating Hydrodynamics (aka Landau-Lifshitz-Navier-Stokes
or Stochastic-Navier-Stokes) if one wants to capture these (see Zhao et
al 19 and Zhang et al 19 in Reading List and references therein).

- Write a code to solve the the thin film equation which incorporates
  thermal fluctuations (see Zhang et al 2019 for details):
  $$
  \frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{t}} +\frac{\partial}{\partial\tilde{x}}\left( \frac{\tilde{h}^3}{3\mathrm{Ca}}\frac{\partial^3 \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}^3} + B \tilde{h}^{3/2}N \right) =0.
  $$
  where $B$ is a dimensionless parameter measuring the strength of
  thermal fluctuations, $N$ represents noise with zero mean which is
  uncorrelated in time and space so that the covariance
  $<N(x,t)N(x',t')>=\delta(x-x')\delta(t-t')$ (where the triangular
  brackets represent an ensemble average and $\delta$ is the Dirac delta
  function. Numerically, for an explicit time step $\triangle t$ and
  mesh size $\triangle x$ one can represent $N$ at every node using
  $$
  N\approx \frac{randn}{\sqrt{\triangle t \triangle x}}
  $$
  where $randn$ are random numbers sampled from a Gaussian distribution with
  mean zero and variance one.

- Implement the code for the case of a periodic domain, where one has
  four boundary conditions
  $\left.\tilde{h}\right|_{x=0} =\left.\tilde{h}\right|_{x=1}$,
  $\left.\frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}}\right|_{x=0} =\left.\frac{\partial \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}}\right|_{x=1}$,
  $\left.\frac{\partial^2 \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}^2}\right|_{x=0} =\left.\frac{\partial^2 \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}^2}\right|_{x=1}$,
  $\left.\frac{\partial^3 \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}^3}\right|_{x=0} =\left.\frac{\partial^3 \tilde{h}}{\partial \tilde{x}^3}\right|_{x=1}$.

- Calculate the 'static capillary wave spectrum' for this case which
  tells you about how strong each of the waves within the domain is. To
  do so, one must calculate the perturbation from the equilibrium film
  height $\delta h(x,t) = h(x,t)-1$ at each time step, take the Fourier
  transform of this to obtain $\hat{\delta \tilde{h}}$ (which is a
  function of wavenumber $\tilde{k}$), take the modulus squared of this
  to obtain a real number $|\hat{\delta \tilde{h}}|^2$ and then average
  over multiple time steps to obtain the spectrum
  $\tilde{S}(\tilde{k}) = \overline{|\hat{\delta \tilde{h}}|^2}$. This
  will be a function of wavenumber $\tilde{k}$ and theory predicts that
  $\tilde{S}(\tilde{k}) \propto \tilde{k}^{-2}$, which one can try to
  predict with the code (note there will be an initial transient during
  which the film becomes rough/noisy and this should be neglected).

If one wants a real challenge\....

- Reproduce results from Zhao et al 2019 for the breakup of liquid
  cylinders. In this case the lubrication equation is applied to a
  cylindrical coordinate system to provide the so-called 'stochastic
  lubrication equation'.
