# Canonical Flows {#sec-flu-canonical}

In this chapter we will consider simple flow configurations in which the
governing equations can be simplified to allow for analytic solutions to
be obtained. Analytic solutions are both useful to gain understanding of
a particular problem but also to provide benchmark cases against which
CFD solutions can be tested.

## 2D Flows

One possible simplification we can make to the full Navier-Stokes equations
is to consider flows that move the fluid in 2D only, reducing the number of
dimensions we need by one. In such 2D flows, the velocity field has two components
which depend on two physical space coordinates and time,
$\bfv = (u(x,y,t), v(x,y,t),0).$ In this case, the vorticity field
has only one non-zero component, $\bfomega = (0,0,\omega(x,y,t))$.

For 2D incompressible flows, a mathematically convenient tool is to
introduce a representation of the velocity field in terms of a special
function, defined as follows.

::: {.callout-note title="Definition"}
The **stream function**, denoted $\psi (x,y,t)$, has the property that
$$
u = \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y}, \quad
v = -  \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}.
$$ {#eq-stream}
:::

The utility of the stream function is that it guarantees that the flow automatically satisfies the
condition of incompressibility, and it means there is one fewer field we need to find (we now only need
$\psi$ and the pressure, $p$).
In terms of the stream function the $z$-component of vorticity is:
$$
\omega =  \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}= -\nabla^2 \psi.
$$ {#eq-2Dvort}

### Relation to Streamlines

We now explore the reason for the name of the stream function, showing that curves where
$\psi=\text{constant}$ are streamlines of the flow.

From the definition of the stream function @eq-stream we have
$$
\bfv \cdot \nabla\psi = u\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} +  v\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y}=0.
$$
This mean that in steady flows (where
$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} =0$ so that
$\frac{\partial\bfv}{\partial t}=0$ too), we have
$$
\frac{D \psi}{D t}=\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}+\bfv\cdot\nabla\psi =0,
$$
i.e. $\psi$ is conserved along the fluid paths. This means that in
steady flows the fluid particles move along lines of constant $\psi$
(streamlines, as defined in @sec-flu-macroscopic), and this explains the name 'stream
function'.

### Volume flux
Another nice propert is that there is a nice relation to the volume flux across a
curve connecting 2 points. The volume flux of fluid, per unit length (as we're in 2D), across
a curve between points $a$ and $b$ is given by
$$
Q = \int_{a}^{b} \bfv\cdot\bfn \,ds
$$
where $s$ is the arclength along a curve between $a$ and $b$ and
$\bfn=(\partial_s y, -\partial_s x)$ is the normal to this
curve. Substituting our expressions for the normal and the velocity
in terms of the streamfunction, we obtain
$$
Q = \int_{a}^{b} \left(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial s}
+ \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial s}\right) ds
= \int_{a}^{b} \frac{d\psi}{ds} ds = \left[\psi\right]^{b}_{a} = \psi(b)-\psi(a).
$$
In other words, the difference of the streamfunction at two points
tells us the value of $Q$ for *any* curve connecting those two points. The fact that there is
unique value for this is something that arises purely due to incompressibility in 2D!

## Plane-Parallel Shear Flows

The most basic 2D flows have plane-parallel configuration in which the
velocity field is everywhere in the same direction and constant along
that direction, i.e.
$$
\bfv ( \bfx, t) = (u (y,t), 0,0);
$$ {#eq-velPlane}
see @fig-planeshear. These flows are simple enough that we don't even really need the stream function;
the stream lines are all just lines of the form $y=\text{constant}$.

::: {#fig-planeshear}

![](tikz/PlaneParallelFlow.svg){height=6cm}

An example of plane-parallel shear flow.

:::

The incompressibility condition for such a velocity field is
automatically satisfied, as $\frac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_i}=0$, and
the nonlinear term $v_j\frac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_j}$ is
automatically zero which greatly simplifies finding solutions. Writing
the Navier--Stokes equation in components, we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
\underbrace{ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}}_{\text{Function of }y,t} &= -\frac 1 \rho  \frac{\partial p}{\partial x}+\underbrace{\nu  \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2},}_{\text{Function of }y,t} \\
0 &= -\frac 1 \rho  \frac{\partial p}{\partial y}.
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-velPlane1}
From the second equation we see that the pressure is
independent of $y$, so that $p=p(x,t)$. From the first one, we see that
its dependence on $x$ is linear, i.e. the pressure force is uniform and
in the $x$-direction, $-\nabla p/\rho = G(t) \bfe_x$ where $G$ is
a function of only time. This leads to the following equation
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}  = G +\nu  \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}.
$$ {#eq-velPlane2}

### Inviscid Steady Plane-Parallel Flow

Let us consider a steady plane-parallel shear flow so that
$\partial_t \bfv =0$ and $\nu=0$. Then we have from
@eq-velPlane1 that
$$
0=  -\frac 1 \rho  \frac{\partial p}{\partial x},\qquad 0 = -\frac 1 \rho  \frac{\partial p}{\partial y},
$$
so that the equations are satisfied for all $\bfv = (u(y), 0, 0)$
with $p=\text{constant}$.

### Couette Flow (surface driven) {#sec-shearflow}

::: {.callout-caution title="Example"}
Consider now a *steady viscous* plane shear flow,
$\bfv = (u(y),0,0)$, between two infinite plates at $y=-W$ and
$y=W$, which are moving in the $x$-direction with velocities $U$ and
$-U$ respectively; see @fig-couette. Pressure in the flow is uniform in space (the
flow is not pressure driven). What is the velocity field?

:::

::: {#fig-couette}

![](tikz/Couette.svg){height=5cm}

Couette flow.

### Poiseuille Flow (pressure driven) {#sec-Poiseuille-flow}

Consider now a *steady viscous* plane shear flow, with boundaries
stationary and the flow is driven by a pressure gradient. Consider a
plane-parallel flow, $\bfv = (u(y),0,0)$, between two infinite
plates at $y=W$ and $y=-W$ which are fixed (not moving); see
@fig-poiseuille. The flow is driven by a uniform pressure
gradient in the $x$-direction,
$-\frac{\partial p }{\partial x} /\rho = G$ where $G=$Â const.

::: {#fig-poiseuille}

![](tikz/Poiseuille.svg){height=5cm}

Poiseuille flow.
:::

Therefore from @eq-velPlane2 we have
$$
\frac{\partial p }{\partial x} /\rho = - G= \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} .
$$
The solution of this equation is $$u(y)=-\frac G {2 \nu} y^2 +By+C.$$
The no-slip boundary conditions to be satisfied are $u(W) =u(-W) =0$.
Thus $B=0$ and $C=  \frac G {2\nu} W^2$, i.e.
$$
u(y) = \frac G {2\nu} (W^2 -y^2).
$$

The volume flux can then be computed as
$$
Q=\int_{-W}^{W} u \,dy = \left[\frac{ G}{2\nu} (W^2y -y^3/3)\right]_{-W}^{W} = \frac{2 G W^3}{3\nu}\propto W^3,
$$
which shows that the mass flux is proportional to the cube of the
channel width $W$ for a given pressure gradient.

For obvious reasons the Poiseuille flow is often called *channel flow*.
Its analogue in cylindrical geometry is a flow commonly observed in
pipes/tubes or our blood vessels and here, $Q\propto R^4$ where $R$ is
the radius of the pipe. A video showing this can be found below.

## Fluids Coursework Project Option 1 {#sec-flu-proj1}

This project is entitled **Poiseuille Flow at the Micro and Nanoscale**, and is one
of two project options you will have in this section of the module. The second will be
described in @sec-flu-proj2.

### Project aims
You should write an approximately 10 page report that demonstrates:

- Engagement with the literature on flow through micro and nano
  geometries where the no-slip boundary condition is violated;

- Computational results for Poiseuille flow through channels and pipes
  for a variety of different boundary conditions; and

- Validation of code against your own analytic results as well as
  experimental and/or theoretical results from the published literature.

### Pipe flow

A more common pressure-driven flow than channel flow is the
flow of liquids and gases through pipes/tubes. For pipe flow, the
natural coordinate system to consider is the cylindrical coordinates
$(r,\theta,z)$, with the $z$-coordinate along the centre-line of the
pipe and the boundary located at a constant radius $r=R$ (see
@fig-pipe) - in this case the domain will be $0\le r\le R$.
We can assume that the velocity takes the form
$\bfv = v_z(r)\bfe_z$, so that, using the Navier--Stokes in
cylindrical coordinates (see Appendix) and in the absence of gravity, we
have:
$$
0 =  -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z} +\nu\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r\frac{\partial v_z}{\partial r}\right)
$$
where we have applied the boundary condition of no slip $u(R)=0$ and
smoothness at $r=0$, i.e. $\frac{\partial v_z}{\partial r}=0$ there.

::: {#fig-pipe}

![](tikz/Pipe.svg){height=5cm}

Pipe flow geometry.

:::

As an exercise you should show that when you haven no-slip $v_z(r=R)=0$
the analytic solution to this equation is
$$
v_z =  \frac{G}{4\nu}(R^2 - r^2)
$$
where
$G=-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}$ is the (constant)
imposed pressure gradient. From this you should be able to find the volume flux and show that it is
$\propto R^4$.

### Slip

A generalisation of the no-slip condition is the Navier slip (known as
Maxwell slip for gases) condition which states that the tangential
velocity at a solid surface is linearly proportional to the shear stress
imposed upon this boundary. The coefficient of proportionality is known
as the 'slip length' $\ell$; when $\ell=0$ the no-slip boundary
condition is recovered.

For the case of a plane-parallel shear flow, in the geometry considered
above, the Navier slip condition is
$$
\ell \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = \pm u\qquad \text{at}\qquad y=\mp W
$$
and replaces the tangential part of the no-slip boundary condition. This
mean we still have zero velocity normal to the boundary $v=0$, due to
impermeability, but now $u\neq0$ in general, just as happens for a free
slip condition. Note that the $\pm$ comes from the fact that the shear
stress $\bfn\cdot\bfS\cdot\bft$ depends on the
normal vector to a boundary

In cylindrical coordinates this condition takes the form
$$
\ell \frac{\partial v_z}{\partial r} = -v_z\qquad \text{at}\qquad r=R
$$

Generally, at large scales the no-slip boundary condition provides
exceptionally accurate results (e.g. for aeronautics); however, as one
goes to micro- and nano-scales, large deviations are observed, both
experimentally and from molecular simulations, for the flow of both
gases and liquids. This suggests the slip length is of the order of
microns or below. The easiest system in which to measure these
deviations is pipe flow, where one can measure the flux through a tube
and compare to analytic solutions obtained with different boundary
conditions. This has become a particularly hot-topic due to the
possibility of using carbon nanotubes in a membrane to filtrate seawater
into drinking water - see article by Reese 2011 (in the Reading List).\

### Project Ideas

The suggestions below are intended to give you ideas of what can be
done, but you should feel free to follow your own path if you wish.

A starting point for this project is to compute Poiseuille flow in a
channel, as considered within the Week 3 Workshop.
Two extensions that should be considered are to consider flow through a pipe, rather than a channel,
and to change the boundary conditions to allow for slip. You will then be able to compare your results to
experiments, such as the volume flux data provided in Whitby et al 2008 (see Reading List below).

#### Pipe Flow
Suggested tasks:

- Derive an analytic solution for 3D axisymmetric flow and use this to
  calculate the volume flux.

- Extend your 2D code to 3D axisymmetric flow and ensure agreement with
  the analytic result. Note, care must be taken at $r=0$ as the
  coordinate system creates $1/r$ terms there. A simple way to impose
  $\frac{\partial v_z}{\partial r}=0$ there is to directly impose this
  equation (instead of the bulk one) by setting $v_1=v_2$, which is
  equivalent to a forward difference at this point. You can also explore
  other possibilities if you like.

- Repeat any steps for channel flow of interest to you.

#### Slip
Suggested tasks:

- Incorporate a Navier-Slip condition for channel flow and see how this
  modifies the solution (note: an analytic solution is still easily
  attainable) and in particular he volume flux.

- Do the same for pipe flow.

#### Going further
For those feeling ambitious, here are some further suggestions:

- Implement the non-linear slip condition derived in Thompson & Troian's
  1997 article (see Reading List), which is an extension of the
  Navier-Slip condition. Derive an appropriate boundary condition for
  pipe flow.

- Use a higher order boundary condition derived for gases and see what
  this changes. One example is equation (7) in Lockerby et al's 2004
  article (see Reading List).

- Consider the model proposed in Myers 2011, where the nanoscale effects
  are attributed to changes in the viscosity near the wall, with no-slip
  retained.

## Circular Flows {#sec-vortices}

Similar to the plane parallel shear flows in which velocity is a
function of one Cartesian coordinate only, one can consider flows with
circular streamlines. Again, this leads to simple enough situations that
we don't need to use the full stream function $\psi$.

We consider cylindrical polar coordinates $(r,\theta,z)$ with 2D flow in
the $(r,\theta)$-plane. Here, the power of using vector calculus becomes
apparent, as the vector equations are valid in all coordinate systems
and the relevant operators can quickly be looked up when required (they
are in the Appendix)

### Circular flows {#sec-circular-flows}

Let us consider a steady 2D flow, $\bfomega = (0,0,\omega)$, such
that in polar coordinates the velocity depends only on the radius and
not on the polar angle, $\bfv = \bfv(r)$ where
$r =\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. An example of such a flow is shown in @fig-circular.

::: {#fig-circular}

![](tikz/Circular.svg){height=6cm}

A generic circular flow; streamlines are dashed, velocity vectors shown in red.
:::

From the incompressibility condition, with
$\bfv=\bfv(r) = v_r\bfe_r + v_\theta \bfe_\theta$,
$$
\nabla\cdot\bfv = \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial (rv_r)}{\partial r} + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial v_{\theta}}{\partial\theta} = 0,
$$
we find that the radial component of the velocity field is zero
everywhere in physical space, as $v_r\propto r^{-1}$ would mean there is a source of mass at
$r=0$, which there is not. We have
$$
\bfv = v_\theta (r) \, \bfe_\theta,
$$
so that the Navier--Stokes equations become:
$$
- \frac{v_\theta^2}{r}  =  -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial r}
$$
$$
0 =  -\frac{1}{\rho r}\frac{\partial p}{\partial \theta} + \underbrace{\nu\left( \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r\frac{\partial  v_\theta }{\partial r}\right) -\frac{v_\theta}{r^2} \right)}_{\text{function of }r\text{ only}},
$$
As $\frac{\partial p}{\partial \theta}$ is a function of only $r$, to
keep $p$ single valued we must have
$\frac{\partial p}{\partial \theta}=0$.  Otherwise, if $\frac{\partial p}{\partial \theta}=f(r)$, for some
function $f(r)$, then $p=f(r)\theta+\text{constant}$, which would be
multi-valued.

If we make the further assumption that the flow is inviscid $\nu=0$ then
we are simply left with
$$
- \frac{v_\theta^2}{r}  =  -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial r},
$$
so that any $v_\theta(r)$ satisfies the equations and can then be used
to find the pressure distribution, as if often the case for inviscid
flow.

The vorticity is then
$$
\bfomega = \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial (r v_\theta)}{\partial r} \bfe_z.
$$
which has an axis in the z-direction ('out of the page') as we would
expect for flow confined to the $(r,\theta)$-plane.

### Solid Body Rotation

Consider the circular streamlines generated by the velocity field
$$
v_{\theta}(r) = \Omega r.
$$

With this velocity, the fluid moves as a rigid body, so that there is
local rotation, i.e. the vorticity is non-zero: $\omega = 2\Omega$ and
is twice the angular velocity $\Omega$, as expected. Therefore, there is
local rotation, see @fig-vortextypes, and fluid particles on the circular
streamlines rotate.

The pressure distribution can then be calculated as
$$
\frac{\partial p}{\partial r} = \rho v_{\theta}^2/r= \rho \Omega^2 r \qquad\rightarrow\qquad p = \rho \Omega^2 r^2/2 + C
$$
where $C$ is a constant.

A video showing rigid body rotation can be found below.

{{< video https://youtu.be/loCLkcYEWD4?t=140 >}}

### Point Vortices

A point vortex is a useful idealisation in which we consider all of the
vorticity to be concentrated at a point. The velocity field is then
$$
v_{\theta}(r) = \frac{a}{r}.
$$

Interestingly, we see that with this velocity field, the flow outside
the singularity at the origin is irrotational
$$
\omega = \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial (r v_{\theta})}{\partial r} - \frac{1}{r}\xcancel{\frac{\partial v_r}{\partial \theta}} = 0,
$$
i.e. there is no local rotation in the flow field. The velocity field
then looks as shown in the first panel of
@fig-vortextypes, with fluid particles on the circular
streamlines retaining a fixed orientation.

However, if we can use Stokes' theorem to show that a point vortex has a
singular vorticity which is located at the origin. Taking a circular
contour of radius $R$ around the origin we have that the circulation
$\Gamma$ is given by:
$$
\Gamma = \oint_{C} \bfv\cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = 2\pi R v_{\theta} = 2\pi a
$$
so that using Stokes' theorem, we find
$$
\Gamma = \int_{A} \bfomega\cdot\bfn \,dA = 2\pi a\neq 0.
$$
However, we know that the flow is irrotational for $r>0$, so we must
have all of the vorticity concentrated at the origin
$$
\omega = \Gamma \delta(\bfx) = 2\pi a \delta(\bfx).
$$

::: {#fig-vortextypes layout-ncol=2}
![](tikz/Vortex-A.svg){height=5cm}

![](tikz/Vortex-B.svg){height=5cm}

Examples of round vortices. First panel: a solid-body rotation, in which
fluid particles (smiley faces) rotate. Second panel: a point vortex flow, in
which the motion is irrotational. A simple analogy is that the solid
body rotation is to think of a person on a merry-go-round for the solid
body rotation (where the rotate with the motion) and a Ferris wheel for
the point vortex (where you always remain orientated in an upright
position, hopefully!).
:::

The pressure distribution, satisfies the r-component of the steady state
Euler equation
$$
\frac{\partial p}{\partial r} =\rho v_{\theta}^2/r = \rho a^2/r^3 \qquad\rightarrow\qquad p = p_{\infty}-\rho a^2/ (2r^2)
$$
where $p_{\infty}$ is the constant pressure value 'at' infinity.

A video showing this motion can be found below.

## Navier--Stokes in Cylindrical Polar Coordinates*

In this extension section, we provide a brief discussion of the Navier-Stokes equations in cylindrical
polar coordinates. These are useful for general problems which have circular symmetry, such as that
considered in pipe flow.

In cylindrical polar coordinates $(r,\theta,z)$, for a velocity field
$\bfv = v_r \bfe_r + v_\theta \bfe_\theta + v_z \bfe_z$, we have that
the divergence is expressed as
$$
\nabla\cdot\bfv = \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial (rv_r)}{\partial r} + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial \theta}+\frac{\partial v_z}{\partial z}.
$$
This expression allows us to find the incompressibility condition in this cylindrical coordinate system.

The vorticity in cylindrical coordinates is the curl, which is expressed as
is
$$
\bfomega = \nabla\times\bfv = \left(  \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial v_z}{\partial \theta} - \frac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial z}  \right)\bfe_r + \left( \frac{\partial v_r}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial v_z}{\partial r}  \right)\bfe_\theta + \frac{1}{r}\left( \frac{\partial (r v_\theta)}{\partial r} - \frac{\partial v_r}{\partial \theta}  \right)\bfe_z.
$$
For a scalar field $f=f(r,\theta,z,t)$, the gradient is
$$
\nabla f= \frac{\partial f}{\partial r}\bfe_r + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta}\bfe_\theta+\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\bfe_z.
$$
All of these expressions can be derived from their Cartesian equivalents, but is a rather time-consuming exercise.
A handy online reference for these (and other operators in other coordinate systems) is provided on Wikipedia, see the table [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_in_cylindrical_and_spherical_coordinates#Del_formula).

Using these calculus operators, and working through, Navier--Stokes equations, with gravitational force in the negative
$z$-direction are given by:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial v_r}{\partial t} + v_r \frac{\partial v_r}{\partial r} + \frac{v_\theta}{r}\frac{\partial v_r}{\partial \theta} + v_z\frac{\partial v_r}{\partial z} - \frac{v_\theta^2}{r} 
&=  -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial r} + \nu\left(\Delta v_r -\frac{v_r}{r^2}-\frac{2}{r^2}\frac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial \theta} \right),\\
\frac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial t} + v_r \frac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial r} + \frac{v_\theta}{r}\frac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial \theta} + v_z\frac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial z} + \frac{v_r v_\theta}{r} 
&=  -\frac{1}{\rho r}\frac{\partial p}{\partial \theta} + \nu\left(\Delta v_\theta -\frac{v_\theta}{r^2}+\frac{2}{r^2}\frac{\partial v_r}{\partial \theta} \right),\\
\frac{\partial v_z}{\partial t} + v_r \frac{\partial v_z}{\partial r} + \frac{v_\theta}{r}\frac{\partial v_z}{\partial \theta} + v_z\frac{\partial v_z}{\partial z}
&=  -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z} +\nu\Delta v_z - g,\\
\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial (rv_r)}{\partial r} + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial \theta}+\frac{\partial v_z}
{\partial z}
&=0,
\end{aligned}
$$
where the first three equations are Cauchy's momentum equation @eq-cauchy, the latter equation is the incompressibility condition @eq-contEq, and the Laplace operator $\Delta$ used in the equations is expressible as
$$
\Delta = \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r\frac{\partial }{\partial r}\right) + \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2} + \frac{\partial^2 }{\partial z^2}.
$$
