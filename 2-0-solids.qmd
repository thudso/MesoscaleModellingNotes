# Solids

## Introduction
In this half of the module our focus switches to solids, and the
modelling of shape change and motion of solid materials under the action
of applied forces. An important fundamental difference between fluids
and solids is that the latter form of matter does not 'flow'. As a
consequence, points in a solid material that are nearby at one time tend
to remain so at later times.

As a thought experiment, consider performing an experiment to observe
the physical properties of a fluid, pouring it into a beaker, stirring
it up and then doing the same experiment again. The fluid has been
completely deformed and distorted by this process, but we expect the
mechanical properties to remain the same. In contrast, we are not able
to do the same to a solid, as solids tend to want to return to its
original shape between experiments: This shows that a solid 'remembers'
its shape in a way a fluid does not. A common approach is to introduce a
reference shape for a solid and measure its shape change relative to
this reference. As we will see, this means it is most convenient to use
a Lagrangian formulation (rather than an Eulerian formulation, as we
used in the fluids part) of the appropriate equations.

During the lectures in this second part, we will cover the following
topics:

- **Linear Elasticity Theory**: strain, Hooke's law, the Lagrangian formalism,
  stress, the equations of elastostatics

- **The Finite Element Method**: weak and strong form of partial differential
  equations, discretisation, basis functions, boundary conditions, implementation

- **Beam Theory**: Bernoulli-Euler beam equation, Finite Elements for the
  reduced problem, other reduced theories

- **Elasticity for Crystal Defects**: point defects as elastic inclusions, the elastic
  Green's function, linking atomistic and continuum theory

In the workshops you will develop your own codes to solve real-world
problems.

- **Computational Solid Mechanics**: the finite element method, basis functions, numerical
  integration, linear algebra, error, meshing and refinement.
