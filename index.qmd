This online book (also available as a pdf via the download link) contains a
complete set of notes for PX912 Continuum and Mesoscale Modelling. This module
forms part of the core training for the
[HetSys Centre for Doctoral Training](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/hetsys/),
and focuses on macroscopic modelling via continuum
mechanics. This modelling approach is in contrast to core module PX911, which is concerned with
microscopic techniques, where individual atoms are treated.
PX912 is split into two 5-week parts, the first on fluid dynamics (in Term 1)
and the second on solid mechanics (in Term 2), and these notes are organised in parallel
with this structure.
